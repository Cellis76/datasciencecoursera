type: s1

Before you sit down:
- Do you have your MCS password?
- Do you have your Raven password?
  - If you answered **'no'** to either then go to the University Computing Services (just outside the door) NOW!
- Are you registered? If not, see me!

The hard bit: get the slides
========================================================
type:sq2

download.file('https://raw.github.com/fredheir/WebScraping/master/Lecture1/p1.Rpres',
destfile='p1.Rpres')

OR: download.file('http://goo.gl/ulTloi', destfile='p1.Rpres')

OLD RSTUDIO:
markdown:

download.file('https://raw.github.com/fredheir/WebScraping/master/Lecture1/p1.Rpres',
destfile='p1.Rmd')

slides in browser. Open:
http://fredheir.github.io/WebScraping/Lecture1/p1.html

Open the file **p1.Rpres** or **p1.Rmd** in RStudio, and press **preview** to view the slides

Who is this course for
===============
<s>Computer scientists</s>

Anyone with some minimal background in coding and good computer literacy


By the end of the course you will have
==============
Created a system to extract text and numbers from a large number of web pages

Learnt to harvest links

Worked with an API to gather data, e.g. from YouTube

Convert messy data into tabular data


What will we need?
==============
A windows Computer

A modern browser - Chrome or Firefox

<s>~~An up to date version of Rstudio~~</s>


Getting help
============
- ?[functionName]
- StackOverflow
- Ask each other. 


Outline

**Theory**

Practice


What is 'Web Scraping'?
========================================================
From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)
> Web scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites.


When might this be useful? (your examples)

Imposing structure on data
=========
Again, from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)
> ... Web scraping focuses on the **transformation of unstructured data** on the web, typically in HTML format, into structured data that can be stored and analyzed in **a central local database or spreadsheet**. 


What will we do today?
==============

```r
a<-fetchData(1,c("Web_scraping","Data_mining"))
ggplot(a,aes(date,rd.views,colour=target))+geom_line()
```

What will we learn?
====================
1) manipulating URLs

2) downloading stuff from within R

3) automate collection through loops and functions



Example
=======
Approximate number of web pages

<img src="https://github.com/fredheir/WebScraping/blob/master/Lecture1/i2.jpg?raw=true" alt="Drawing" />

Tabulate this data
======


```r
require (ggplot2)
clubs <- c("Tottenham","Arsenal","Liverpool",
           "Everton","ManU","ManC","Chelsea")
nPages <- c(23.3,68.4,78.9,35.5,102,90.5,110)
df <- data.frame(clubs,nPages)
df
```

```
      clubs nPages
1 Tottenham   23.3
2   Arsenal   68.4
3 Liverpool   78.9
4   Everton   35.5
5      ManU  102.0
6      ManC   90.5
7   Chelsea  110.0
```
